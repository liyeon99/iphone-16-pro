              Apple&nbsp;Card Monthly Installments (ACMI) is a 0% APR payment option that is only available if you
              select
              it
              at checkout in the U.S. for eligible products purchased at Apple&nbsp;Store locations, <a
                href="/">apple.com</a>, the Apple&nbsp;Store app, or by calling 1‑800‑MY‑APPLE, and is subject to credit
              approval and credit limit. See <a href="#">support.apple.com/kb/HT211204</a> for more information about
              eligible products. APR ranges may vary based on when you accepted an Apple&nbsp;Card. Cardholders who
              accept
              an Apple&nbsp;Card on and/or after August 1, 2024: Variable APRs for Apple&nbsp;Card, other than ACMI,
              range
              from 19.24% to 29.49% based on creditworthiness. Rates as of August 1, 2024. Existing cardholders: See
              your
              Customer Agreement for applicable rates and fee. If you buy an ACMI‑eligible product by choosing to pay in
              full with Apple&nbsp;Card (instead of using ACMI), that purchase is subject to the Apple&nbsp;Card
              variable
              APR, not 0% APR. Taxes and shipping on ACMI purchases are subject to the variable APR, not 0% APR. When
              you
              buy an iPhone with ACMI, you’ll need to select AT&amp;T, Boost Mobile, T‑Mobile, or Verizon as your
              carrier
              when you check out. An iPhone purchased with ACMI is always unlocked, so you can switch carriers at any
              time.
              ACMI is not available for purchases made online at the following special stores: Apple Employee Purchase

              will be the product’s purchase price, less all other payments at the monthly payment amount. ACMI
              financing

            configuration and many other factors; actual results will vary. Battery has limited recharge cycles and may
            eventually need to be replaced. Battery life and charge cycles vary by use and settings. See <a
